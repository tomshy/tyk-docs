The Tyk Dashboard has a separate configuration file, it is small and comes packaged with the tarball. It uses a separate configuration file as it may be installed on a different host to your Tyk Gateway nodes.

The Dashboard configuration file can be found in the `tyk-dashboard` folder and by default is called `tyk_analytics.conf`, though it can be renamed and specified using the `--conf` flag.

### Environment Variables

Environment variables can be used to override the settings defined in the configuration file. See [Environment Variables](/docs/configure/environment-variables/) for details. Where an environment variable is specified, its value will take precedence over the value in the configuration file.

The file will look like the sample below, the various fields are explained in the following sections:

}
```


* `listen_port`: Setting this value will change the port that Tyk Dashboard listens on. By default Tyk will try to listen on port `3000`.

* `notifications_listen_port`: port used for WebSocket connections for real-time dashboard notifications. Defaults to `5000`.

> **NOTE**: You may see `net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` errors in the browser console if you don't have port 5000 open. See [Port 5000 Errors in the Browser Console](/docs/troubleshooting/tyk-dashboard/port-5000-errors/).

* `tyk_api_config`: This section contains details for a Tyk Gateway node that the Tyk Dashboard can speak to. The Dashboard controls Tyk using the Gateway API and only requires visibility to one node, so long as all nodes are using the same API Definitions.
    
> **Important**: If the Dashboard cannot see a Tyk node, key management functions will not work properly.

> **Warning**: In a sharded environment, the Gateway node specified in `tyk_api_config` must not be sharded.

*   `tyk_api_config.Host`: This is the full URL of your Tyk node.

*   `tyk_api_config.Port`: The port that Tyk is running on. The default is `8080`.

*   `tyk_api_config.Secret`: The secret set in your `tyk.conf` file. This is the key that Tyk Dashboard will use to speak to the Tyk node's Gateway API. Note that this value has to match the `secret` value in `tyk.conf`.


*   `shared_node_secret`: As of Tyk Gateway **v2.0** and Tyk Dashboard **v1.0** all Tyk API Gateway nodes that are configured to use the Dashboard as a back-end API Definition service (i.e. are managed by a Dashboard) will register with the Dashboard service on load, and claim a node ID that is provided by the license for the Dashboard. Please note that this value should match with [`node_secret`](https://tyk.io/docs/configure/tyk-gateway-configuration-options/#a-name-node-secret-a-node-secret) Gateway configuration option value.
    
Each node communicates with the Dashboard via a shared secret (this setting) and a nonce to ensure that out-of-band requests cannot be made. Nodes will send a heartbeat every few seconds to notify the Dashboard that they are running.

*   `admin_secret`: This secret is to be used by a special set of endpoints that we call "Admin APIs". This API is part of the super-admin context and therefore has a separate endpoint prefix `/admin`. It also requires a special auth header called `admin-auth`.
This purpose of these endpoints is to allow functionality that regular Dashboard users should not have, such as create new organisations, create super users etc. See the [Admin API](https://tyk.io/docs/dashboard-admin-api/) for more information on these endpoints.

*   `mongo_url`: The full URL to your MongoDB instance, this can be a clustered instance if necessary and should include the database and username / password data.
    
> **Important**: This should be the same as the credentials that your Tyk installation uses.

*   `mongo_ssl_insecure_skip_verify`: Allows usage of self-signed certificates when connecting to an encrypted MongoDB database.

*   `mongo_use_ssl`: Boolean setting for Mongo SSL support. Set to `true` to enable SSL.

*   `page_size`: The page size that the dashboard should use. Defaults to `10`. Should not be edited.

*   `redis_port`: The port that your Redis installation is on.
    
> **Important**: The Tyk Dashboard uses Redis to store its session data and to communicate with your Tyk Gateway nodes occasionally. The Redis details used by the dashboard must be the same as those set for your Tyk installation.

*   `redis_host`: The hostname for the Redis collection and can be an IP address.

*   `redis_password`: If you have a set a password in your Redis configuration using its `requirepass` setting, enter it here. If this is set to empty, The Dashboard will not attempt to login to Redis.

*   `redis_database`: Set this to the index of your Redis database if you are using more than one.

*   `redis_timeout`: Set custom redis network timeout. Default value: 5 seconds.

*   `enable_cluster`: Set this to `true` if you are using a Redis cluster, then fill in the `redis_hosts` field.

*   `redis_hosts`: You can also specify multiple Redis hosts here. Tyk will use this array if it is not empty, or it will use the individual legacy parameters above. You can specify multiple `host:port` combinations here.

*   `force_api_defaults`: Forces the Dashboard to use certain defaults when generating API definitions. Set this to `false` if you wish to manually set `listen_paths`.

*   `notify_on_change`: Licensed users can use this setting to enable/disable whether Tyk Dashboard will notify all Tyk Gateway nodes to hot-reload when an API definition is changed.

*   `license_owner`: Deprecated, licenses are no long required to use the Dashboard.

*   `hash_keys`: If your Tyk Gateway is using hashed tokens, set this value here to `true` so it matches. The Dashboard will now operate in a mode that is compatible with key hashing.

*   `enable_delete_key_by_hash`: To delete a key by its hash, set this option to `true`.

*  `enable_master_keys`: If this value is set to true, session objects (key definitions) that do not have explicit access rights set will be allowed by Tyk. This means that keys that are created have access to ALL APIs, which in many cases is unwanted behaviour unless you are sure about what you are doing. To use this setting also requires the corresponding Gateway configuration setting [allow_master_keys](/docs/configure/tyk-gateway-configuration-options/#a-name-allow-master-keys-a-allow-master-keys) to be set to `true`.

*   `email_backend`: Tyk supports an interface-based email back-end system.We support `mandrill`, `sendgrid`, `amazonses` and `mailgun`. See [Outbound Email Configuration][4] for more details on configuring these different providers.

*   `enable_email_notifications`: Set to `true` to have Tyk send emails for things such as key approvals and portal sign ups.

*   `code`: The code of the back-end to use, `mandrill`, `sendgrid`, `amazonses` and `mailgun` are supported. See [Outbound Email Configuration](/docs/configure/outbound-email-configuration/) for more details on configuring these different providers.

*   `email_backend.settings`: The custom settings sections for the back end.

*   `settings.ClientKey`: The client key that we can use to integrate with the Mandrill API.

*   `default_from_email`: The address to send email from.

*   `default_from_name`: The name to use when sending emails.

*   `dashboard_domain`: Your public dashboard hostname.

> **Note**: `dashboard_domain` is available from v1.3.6 onwards.

*   `hide_listen_path`: If you set this option to `true`, then the listen path will not be editable or visible in the Dashboard.

*   `use_sentry`: The Tyk Dashboard has Sentry integration to externalise logging. Set this to `true` to enable the logger.

*   `sentry_code`: If you have a Sentry setup, or are using Getsentry, you can add the Sentry DSN here and Tyk will begin sending events.

*   `sentry_js_code`: The Angular application that powers the Dashboard also supports Sentry. To have the Dashboard report errors to you, add a seperate DSN here.

*   `show_org_id`: Determines whether the RPC ID will be shown in the Users -> Username detail page. This can be useful for quickly identifying your Org ID.

*   `enable_duplicate_slugs`: By default Tyk will try to stop you from using duplicate API slugs. However since Tyk v1.9 supports per-API domain names, it would be possible to have two APIs both listen to the same path (e.g. root `/`), but on different domains.

Setting this option to `true` will cause the dashboard to not validate against other listen paths.

*   `host_config`: The host config section replaces the old `hostname` option in the `tyk_analytics.conf` as we have more options around managing host names and domains in this version.

*   `host_config.override_hostname`: This is the equivalent of v1.8 `hostname` parameter, it will essentially stop Tyk from trying to guess which hostname to use when building URLs for the interface. Set this value to whatever hostname your Tyk Gateway is running on.

*   `host_config.disable_org_slug_prefix`: Tyk will by default try to manage domain names based on the organisation slug, so domains are like this if using the Host Manager:

```
org-slug.hostname.com/api-slug
```
    
However, if you are not using the host manager, then domains are hard-coded per api, or at a gateway level, and the org-slug moniker is not needed to construct demo URLs (e.g. for Swagger docs and the API pages). To stop this guessing behaviour, change this option to `true` and the Dashboard will stop trying to add an org-slug to the start of URL's.
    
For legacy installs or upgrades using the host manager, leave this value as `false`.

*   `host_config.enable_host_names`: The Tyk Dashboard can bind the Dashboard application to a specific domain name. Enable this option to have the Dashboard only allow access on a specific domain and 404 on any other host access (not recommended).

*   `host_config.hostname`: The hostname to bind the Dashboard to. This must be a proper hostname and **not** `localhost`.

*   `host_config.portal_domains`: It is possible to hard-code portal domains (these override settings set by the dashboard for routing purposes). Set `ORGID:Domainname` here so that Tyk can route domain names for the portals of those organisations.

*   `host_config.portal_root_path`: The root path for the portal.

*   `host_config.generate_secure_paths`: As of v2.1, Tyk Dashboard tries to generate URLs for you that can be used straight from the Dashboard. If you prefer to have the URLs start with `https`, set this option to `true`. This is a purely aesthetic change.

*   `host_config.secure_cookies`: This enables HTTPS "secure" cookies.

> **NOTE:** This option is available from v1.3.5 onwards.

*   `http_server_options`: This section is reserved for settings relating to the HTTP server that powers the Dashboard.

*   `http_server_options.use_ssl`: Enable to use SSL.

*   `http_server_options.certificates`: Add a certificate block for each domain being covered by the application:

```{.copyWrapper}
{
  "domain_name": "*.banana.com",
  "cert_file": "new.cert.cert",
  "key_file": "new.cert.key"
}
```

*   `http_server_options.ssl_ciphers`: Array of allowed cipher suites as defined at https://golang.org/pkg/crypto/tls/#pkg-constants

*   `http_server_options.prefer_server_ciphers`: Boolean value to control whether server selects the client's most preferred ciphersuite, or the server's most preferred ciphersuite. If set to `true`, the server's preference in order of the elements in `ssl_ciphers` is used.
    
For more information see [TLS and SSL](/docs/security/tls-and-ssl/)

*   `security`: This section controls login limits for both the Dashboard and the Developer Portal. The path for you audit log is also set here.

> **NOTE:** This section is available from v1.3.5 onwards

*   `security.login_failure_username_limit`: Controls how many time a user can attempt to log in before being denied access. The default is 0.

*   `security.login_failure_ip_limit`: Controls how many times an IP Address can be used to attempt to log in before being denied access. The default is 0.

*   `security.login_failure_expiration`: Controls how long before the failure limits are reset in seconds. The default is 900 seconds.

*   `security.login_disallow_forward_proxy`: Set to `true` to allow the Tyk Dashboard login to ignore the host from the `X-Forwarded-For` header when accessing the Dashboard via a proxy. This can be useful for limiting retry attempts.    

*   `security.audit_log_path`: This sets the path to your audit log and enables audit with default settings. It will log all user actions and response statuses to it. Security information such as passwords are not logged.

*   `security.allow_admin_reset_password`: This allows an admin user to reset the password of other users. The default is false.

*   `security.enable_content_security_policy`: Enable browser Content-Security-Policy, e.g. CSP. The default is false.

*   `security.allowed_content_sources`: If CSP enabled, specify space separated string, with list of allowed resources.

> **NOTE** From 1.8 we have included enhancements to password management in the dashboard

*   `security.user_password_max_days` Set the maximum lifetime of a password for a user. They will be prompted to reset if password lifetime exceeds the configured expiry value. e.g. if value set to `30` any user password set over 30 days in past will be considered invalid and must be reset.

*   `security.enforce_password_history` Set a maximum number of previous passwords used by a user that cannot be reused. e.g. If set to `5` the user upon setting their password cannot reuse any of their 5 most recently used password for that Tyk user account.

*   `security.force_first_login_pw_reset` A newly created user will be forced to reset their password upon first login. Defaults to `false`.

*   `home_dir`: The path to the home directory of Tyk Dashboard, this must be set in order for Portal templates and other files to be loadable. By default this is `/opt/tyk-dashboard/`.

*   `dashboard_session_lifetime` As of v1.3.6 you can set session timeout for a Dashboard in seconds. Defaults to 1 hour.

*   `portal_session_lifetime`: As of v1.5, you can set portal session life time in seconds.

*   `identity_broker`: Tyk Dashboard 1.0 has some preset Tyk Identity Broker configurations set up, for this integration to work, Tyk Dashboard must be able to see an Identity Broker instance. The settings in this section are to enable this integration.

*   `identity_broker.enabled`: Enable the TIB integration (otherwise it will not appear in the UI).

*   `identity_broker.host`: This section defines the host connection details for TIB.

*   `identity_broker.host.connection_string`: The URL to the host. It must be in the form: `http://domain:port`.

*   `identity_broker.host.secret`: The shared secret between TIB and the Dashboard. This ensures all API requests between Dashboard and TIB are valid.

*   `allow_explicit_policy_id`: As of v1.1, by default in a Pro installation, Tyk will load Policy IDs and use the internal object-ID as the ID of the policy. This is not portable in cases where the data needs to be moved from installation to installation.
    
If you set this value to `true`, then the `id` parameter in a stored policy (or imported policy using the REST API of the Dashboard) will be used instead of the internal ID.
    
> **Note**: This option should only be used when transporting an installation to a new database.

*   `use_sharded_analytics`: If using the `mongo-pump-selective` pump, where data is written to org-id-specific collections in MongoDB, then enabling this option will switch querying for analytics over to the independent collection entries.

*   `enable_aggregate_lookups`: If using the new Aggregate Pump, Tyk Analytics can make use of the newer, faster Analytics lookup, to ensure that this can be made backwards compatible. This option must be set to `true`, in conjunction with the `aggregate_lookup_cutoff` value.

*   `aggregate_lookup_cutoff`: Set this to a date value of the form `DD/MM/YYYY`. Any analytics queries before this date will fall back to the raw base log data collection (slower). This is to ensure continuity of service and a smooth upgrade process with no loss of data.

*   `disable_parallel_sessions`: If set to `true`, it restricts an account to a single session. When an account logs in, any other open sessions for that account are logged out.

*   `sso_permission_defaults`: Specify permissions of the user who logged in using Admin SSO API (for example Tyk Identity Broker). See [Dashboard Admin SSO API](https://tyk.io/docs/dashboard-admin-api/sso/) for more details.
*   `sso_custom_login_url`: Specify a custom dashboard login URL if you are using 3rd party authentication like TIB.
*   `sso_custom_portal_login_url`: Specify custom portal login URL if you are using 3rd party authentication like TIB.

*   `enable_multi_org_users`: As of 1.8, this enables the ability to share users across multiple organisations in a Tyk Dashboard Installation (Note: requires > 2 node licence). 

> **NOTE:** `audit` is available from v1.8 onwards

*   `audit`: This section specifies settings for audit logging. All Dashboard API requests with URI starting with `/api` will be logged in audit log.

*   `audit.enabled`: Enables audit logging, set to `false` by default. NOTE: setting value `security.audit_log_path` has the same effect as setting `enabled` to `true`

*   `audit.format`: Specifies the format of audit log file, possible values are `json` and `text` (`text` is default value)

*   `audit.path`: Specifies path to file with audit log, overwrites value `security.audit_log_path` if it was set

*   `audit.detailed_recording`: Enables detailed records in audit log, by defaultt set to `false`. If set to `true` then audit log records will contain http-request (without body) and full http-response including body

Audit record fields for `json` format:

*   `req_id` - unique request ID

*   `org_id` - organization ID

*   `date` - date in `RFC1123` format

*   `timestamp` - unix timestamp

*   `ip` - IP address the request was originating from

*   `user` - dashboard user who performed the request

*   `action` - description of action performed (`i.e. `Update User`)

*   `method` - HTTP-method of the request

*   `url` - URL of the request

*   `status` - HTTP response status of the request

*   `diff` - provides diff of changed fields (available only for PUT requests)

*   `request_dump` - HTTP request copy (available if `audit.detailed_recording` is set to `true`)

*   `response_dump` - HTTP response copy (available if `audit.detailed_recording` is set to `true`)

Audit record fields for `text` format - all fields are in plain text separated with new line and provided in the same order as fields for `json` format.

*  `enable_multi_org_users`: Set to `true` to create users in different organisations, using the same email address. Users will then be able to select an organisation when logging in, and can easily switch between organisations via the navigation menu.

> **NOTE**: This is only available for clients with a two node or more Tyk Dashboard licence.
